<!-- 
     All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.
     The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.
     
     In HTML 5, the declaration is: <!DOCTYPE html> 
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- 
     The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document.
     The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements. 
-->
<html lang="en">

<!-- 
    The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
    
    Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
    
    Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
    
    The following elements can go inside the <head> element:
        1. <title> (required in every HTML document) tag  
        2. <style> tag  
        3. <base> tag  
        4. <link> tag 
        5. <meta> tag 
        6. <script> tag
        7. <noscript> tag

    <!--
        The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.
        
        Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.
        
        Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.
        
        There is a method to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page), through the <meta> tag

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    
    <!--
        The <title> tag defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
        
        The <title> tag is required in HTML documents!
    -->
    <title>Basic Tag</title>
    
</head>

<!-- 
    The <body> tag defines the document's body.
    
    The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
-->
<body>
   
   <!--
       The <h1> to <h6> tags are used to define HTML headings.
       
       <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.
   -->
   <h1>Md Najmul Ovi</h1>
   
   <!--
       The <p> tag defines a paragraph.
       
       Browsers automatically add a single blank line before and after each <p> element.
