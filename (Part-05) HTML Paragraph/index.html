         A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.
         
         The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.
         
         A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
         
         
    -->   
    <p>
    This paragraph
    contains a lot of lines
    in the source code,
    but the browser 
    ignores it.
    </p>

    <p>
    The number of lines in a paragraph depends on the size of the browser window. If you resize the browser window, the number of lines in this paragraph will change.
    </p>

        HTML Horizontal Rules:
          The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
          
          The <hr> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.
          
          The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:
    -->
    <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
    <p>This is some text.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
    <p>This is some other text.</p>
    <hr>
    
    
    <!--
         HTML Line Breaks:
            The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
            
            The <br> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.
            
            Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:      
    -->
    <p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
    
    
    <!--
         The Poem Problem:
           The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
           
           The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
    -->
    <pre>
        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

        My Bonnie lies over the sea.

        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

        Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
    </pre>
