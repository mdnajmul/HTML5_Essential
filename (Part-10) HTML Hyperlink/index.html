    HTML Links - Hyperlinks:
       HTML links are hyperlinks.

       We can click on a link and jump to another document.

       When we move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

       Note: A link does not have to be text. It can be an image or any other HTML element!
-->

                                                
<!--
    Use the <a> element to define a link
    Use the href attribute to define the link address
    Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document
    Use the <img> element (inside <a>) to use an image as a link
-->
                        
<!--
    The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:
         <a href="url">link text</a>
         
    The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

    The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.

    Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.     
-->
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Visit YouTube</a>

<!--
    By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
        -> An unvisited link is underlined and blue
        -> A visited link is underlined and purple
        -> An active link is underlined and red
-->


<!--
    Link to Relative URLs:
       A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part):
-->
<a href="about,html">Go to About Page</a>


<!--
    The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
    
    The target attribute can have one of the following values:
       ->   _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it      was clicked
         
       ->  _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
          
       ->   _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
          
       ->   _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window
-->
