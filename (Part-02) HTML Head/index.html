    The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
    
    Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
    
    Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
    
    The following elements can go inside the <head> element:
        1. <title> (required in every HTML document) tag  
        2. <style> tag  
        3. <base> tag  
        4. <link> tag 
        5. <meta> tag 
        6. <script> tag
        7. <noscript> tag

        The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.
        
        The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

        The <link> tag defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource.
        The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets.
        The <link> element is an empty element, it contains attributes only.

        The <script> tag is used to embed a client-side script (JavaScript).
        
        The <script> element either contains scripting statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute.
        
        Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.
